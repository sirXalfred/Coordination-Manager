# Gitleaks -- Tool Rationale

## What it is

Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting hardcoded secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens,
private keys, HTTP auth headers, bearer tokens) in Git repositories and local directories.
It is open source (MIT), maintained by Gitleaks LLC / Zachary Rice, and distributed via
official GitHub releases and the winget package `Gitleaks.Gitleaks`.

Current version in use: 8.30.1 (checked 2026-06-12)

## What it adds over homegrown checks

The most important thing Gitleaks adds over many homegrown checks is **history awareness**.
It has three scanning modes -- `git`, `dir`, and `stdin` -- and the `git` mode explicitly
uses `git log -p`. That lets you do a one-time full-history scan, limit scans to a commit
range, or scan the repo as part of CI in a way that is grounded in actual git deltas rather
than only the files sitting in the current working tree.

Operationally, Gitleaks is more than a grep script. Its built-in workflow supports:

- Creating a **baseline** and ignoring already-known historical findings on future runs.
- A rule model that supports custom configs, extension of default rules, keyword prefilters,
  entropy thresholds, and global or rule-specific allowlists.
- **Secret redaction in logs** and structured report output (JSON) that other tooling can consume.

That matters because once a repo has even a small amount of legacy noise, the long-term
success of secret scanning depends less on raw detection and more on whether the team can
keep the signal-to-noise ratio manageable.

## Scanning modes

| Mode | How it works | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `git` | Walks `git log -p`; sees the full commit history | CI + one-time full-history audit |
| `dir` | Scans files in the current working tree | Pre-release working-tree check |
| `stdin` | Reads from standard input | Pipe integration |

**Recommended command for this repo:**

```bash
# Full history scan (run once per release and after any suspected exposure)
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose

# CI: only new commits in a PR (faster; avoids re-scanning all of history)
gitleaks detect --source . --log-opts "origin/main..HEAD" --verbose

# Generate baseline file (run once, commit .gitleaks-baseline.json)
gitleaks detect --source . --report-path .gitleaks-baseline.json

# Subsequent runs: ignore findings already in the baseline
gitleaks detect --source . --baseline-path .gitleaks-baseline.json --verbose
```

## Baseline workflow

1. Run `gitleaks detect --report-path .gitleaks-baseline.json` on the current repo state.
2. Review the output. Rotate any real secrets found. Document known false positives.
3. Commit `.gitleaks-baseline.json` to the repo.
4. Add a `.gitleaks.toml` config with allowlist rules for confirmed non-secrets.
5. All subsequent CI runs use `--baseline-path` so only new findings fail the build.
6. Rotate the baseline (regenerate) at each public release milestone.

## CI integration approach

The Gitleaks CLI is MIT-licensed and can be invoked inside any standard GitHub Actions job
(e.g. `run: gitleaks detect ...` after installing the binary). This is the approach used
in the CI workflow for this project.

The official Gitleaks GitHub Action (`gitleaks/gitleaks-action`) requires a
`GITLEAKS_LICENSE` for organization-owned repositories. To avoid this dependency, the
workflow uses the CLI directly in a standard `run:` step rather than the Action. This is
explicitly the pattern their documentation recommends for org repos that do not have a
license.

## Where this fits the project

Gitleaks is a good fit for Coordination Manager because:

- The repo touches many secret namespaces: Supabase keys, JWT secrets, Discord tokens,
  SMTP credentials, Google OAuth secrets, bot shared secrets, AI API keys.
- The curated private-to-public sync pipeline requires high confidence that no secrets
  appear anywhere in history before publishing. A git-history-aware scan is essential.
- The MIT license is compatible with our open-source goals.
- It is easy to understand: non-ML, rule-based, inspectable, and self-hostable.

## Where it is used

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `scripts/security-check.ps1` | Local developer gate; invoked by `pnpm security:check` |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI gate on every PR and push to `main` |
| Pre-release checklist | One-time full-history scan before public milestone sync |

## Installation (Windows)

```powershell
# Via winget (recommended -- verifies SHA256 against published GitHub release checksum)
winget install --id Gitleaks.Gitleaks --exact --accept-source-agreements

# Or run the security gate script with -InstallGitleaks flag
pnpm security:check -InstallGitleaks
```
